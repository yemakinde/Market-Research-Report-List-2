<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diaphragm Compressors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Stage</li><li>Two Stage</li><li>Multi Stage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Diaphragm compressors are classified into three main types based on the number of stages they have: single stage, two stage, and multi stage. Single stage compressors have one diaphragm that compresses the gas in a single stroke. Two stage compressors have two diaphragms that compress the gas in two stages, leading to higher pressure. Multi stage compressors have multiple diaphragms that compress the gas in multiple stages, enabling even higher pressure levels to be achieved. Each type of compressor is suited for different pressure requirements and applications.</p></p>
