<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermostatic Steam Trap Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bi-metal Strip Type</li><li>Balanced Pressure Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermostatic steam traps are important components in steam systems for removing condensate and air. There are two main types of thermostatic steam traps - Bi-metal Strip Type and Balanced Pressure Type. Bi-metal Strip Type traps use a bi-metal strip that expands and contracts with temperature changes to open and close the trap, while Balanced Pressure Type traps use a bellows or diaphragm to sense temperature changes and modulate the trap operation. Both types are effective in ensuring efficient steam system operation.</p></p>
