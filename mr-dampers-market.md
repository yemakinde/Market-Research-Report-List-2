<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The MR Dampers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Damper</li><li>Semi Active Damper</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Active dampers are electronic controlled dampers that adjust in real time to changing road conditions, providing the highest level of performance by actively regulating damping force. Semi-active dampers use a combination of passive and active technologies to provide a more cost-effective solution than active dampers, as they can adjust damping rates based on driver input or road conditions, but do not require as much power to operate. Both types of dampers have their own unique market segments based on performance requirements and cost considerations.</p></p>
