<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Logic Comparators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Collector</li><li>Totem-Pole</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Logic comparators are circuits that compare two binary inputs and produce an output based on the relationship between the inputs. Open collector and totem-pole are two common types of logic comparators. In an open collector comparator, the output transistor acts as a switch that pulls the output low to ground when activated. In a totem-pole comparator, both PNP and NPN transistors are used to provide both high and low output levels. Each type has its own advantages and suitable applications based on their unique characteristics.</p></p>
