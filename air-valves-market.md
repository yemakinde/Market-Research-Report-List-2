<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-Release Valves</li><li>Air/Vacuum Valves</li><li>Combination Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Air valves are essential components in water distribution systems to ensure proper functioning and prevent issues like airlocks or vacuum conditions. The market for air valves consists of three main types: air-release valves, which release air from pipelines to prevent air buildup; air/vacuum valves, which prevent vacuum formation and allow air to enter the system when needed; and combination valves, which combine the functions of both air-release and air/vacuum valves for comprehensive system maintenance. Each type serves a specific purpose in maintaining efficient water flow and system integrity.</p></p>
