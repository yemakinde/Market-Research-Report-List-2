<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sortation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Linear Sortation Systems</li><li>Loop Sortation Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Linear sortation systems are used for simple sorting tasks where items are transported in a straight line and diverted into different chutes or lanes based on their destination. Loop sortation systems, on the other hand, utilize a continuous loop conveyor to transport items through a series of divert points for sorting. Linear systems are typically used for lower throughput operations, while loop systems are more commonly used in high-speed and high-volume distribution centers. Both systems are essential for optimizing efficiency and accuracy in material handling and distribution processes.</p></p>
